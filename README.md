# Advent of Code 2023
These are completed exercises from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

Advent of Code (AoC) is the brainchild of [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). According to AoC's website, 
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Every day, participants have the opportunity to solve 2 puzzles. You are given some test data and some 'final' data that, when run through
your program, should produce the correct solution. You can verify if your solution is correct by submitting a simple result on the AoC website.

This year, I'm using R. My specific goals:
1. Improve my R skills in general
2. Code in a way idiomatic to R
3. Learn how to write code that is efficient, without sacrificing readability
